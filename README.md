# TiddlyWiki5 Syntax README

This extension adds TiddlyWiki5 syntax-highlighting and snippets to Visual Studio Code. [TiddlyWiki5](http://tiddlywiki.com) is a rich, interactive tool for manipulating complex data, with structures that do not easily fit into conventional tools like spreadsheets or wordprocessors. It is a javascript environment that lives in the Browser and Node.js (and a few other implementations) which builds a Wiki/Content Management System. The design recommends building with "the smallest semantically meaningful chunks" â€“ named **tiddlers**. A tiddler could be a system javascript module that is loaded on wiki boot, or a few paragraphs of user notes on a topic, or a wikitext function that build a Table of Contents out of a set of related Tags.

When run in the browser, each **tiddler** is a javascript object in memory (and is also represented as a json in custom `<script class="tiddlywiki-tiddler-store" type="application/json"></script>` element when the wiki is saved as a "single file" `*.html`). When run under Node.js, TiddlyWiki saves each wikitext **tiddler** to disk as a separate text file with a `*.tid` extention. Other "MIME Types" (images, json text, etc) are saved by the server along with a `*.meta` file that describes all other tiddler-fields (the file-content becoms the "text" field when loaded into the wiki).

This extension is intended for editing seperate tiddler files on disk with Visual Studio Code.

## Features

Based primarily on the grammars found below, with heavy tweaking and editing.

* https://github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-grammars/grammars/html.json
* https://github.com/PaulPorfiroff/atom-language-tiddlywiki5
* https://github.com/roma0104/sublime-tid

`*.tid` and `*.meta` files have syntaxes that parse the metadata field "block" (and illegal characters detected). All field content (text field included) is parsed as `text.html.tiddlywiki5` (defined in `./syntaxes/tiddlywiki5.json`).
