# TiddlyWiki5 Syntax README

This extension adds TiddlyWiki5 syntax-highlighting to Visual Studio Code. [TiddlyWiki5](http://tiddlywiki.com) is a rich, interactive tool for manipulating complex data with structure that do not easily fit into conventional tools like spreadsheets or wordprocessors. It is a javascript environment that lives in the Browser and Node.js (and a few other implementations) which builds a Wiki/Content Management System out of "the smallest semantically meaningful chunks" â€“ named **tiddlers**. When run in the browser, each **tiddler** is a javascript object in memory (and is also represented as a json in custom `<script class="tiddlywiki-tiddler-store" type="application/json"></script>` element when the wiki is saved as a "single file" `*.html`).

When run under Node.js, TiddlyWiki saves each wikitext **tiddler** to disk as a separate text file with a `*.tid` extention. Other "MIME Types" (images, json text, etc) are saved by the server along with a `*.meta` file that describes all other tiddler-fields (the file-content becoms the "text" field when loaded into the wiki).

This extension is intended for editing seperate tiddler files on disk with Visual Studio Code.

## Features

Based primarily on the grammars found below, with heavy tweaking and editing.

* https://github.com/PaulPorfiroff/atom-language-tiddlywiki5
* https://github.com/roma0104/sublime-tid

`*.tid` and `*.meta` files have their field-names identified (and illegal characters detected). All field content (text field included) is parsed as "text.html.tiddlywiki5" (defined in `./syntaxes/tw5-wikitext.json`).

# Release Notes

## 1.0.2
- Updated `tid` Snippet to offer a dropdown of `type` field options.
-- Mahalo to "_Phi / hpx1" for the contributions!

## 1.0.1

- Fixed snippets to correctly render widget syntax, `<$button> </$button>`.
- Added a very nifty "Tiddler Metadata" snippet, `tid`, which will insert a block of tiddler meta-data fields into an empty *.tid file. Just type `tid` and press tab. `created` and `modified` fields come automatically timestamped, and you can tab to move between field values.
-- Very neat, thanks a lot to "_Phi / hpx1" for this snippet!

## 1.0.0

- Release!

## 0.1.2

- Improved variable, tranclusion, link, and macro definition recognition
- Setup seperate "language names" for *.tid / *.meta ("tid"), vs  / *.multids files ("multitids") vs *.tw / *.tw5 wikitext ("tiddlywiki5"). This helps debugging and with certain grammar features (injections).
- Mapped MIME types

## 0.1.1

- Improved string and pragma recognition

## 0.1.0

- Initial release
