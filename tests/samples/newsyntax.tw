!! Conditional Shortcut Syntax

added a new shortcut syntax for concisely expressing if-then-else logic. This is the first of a new type of wikitext syntax based on tokens delimited with <% and %>. We plan to introduce other structures using the same format such as a "case" statement.

These new token-based shortcuts allow a richer structure and expressivity than existing features such as widgets or pragmas. For example:

<% if [<animal>match[Elephant]] %>
  It is an elephant
<% elseif [<animal>match[Giraffe]] %>
	It is a giraffe
<% else %>
	It is completely unknown
<% endif %>

Behind the scenes, the conditional shortcut syntax is rendered as the equivalent ListWidgets.
